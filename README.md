## Introduction

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ã‡aÄŸhan KÃ¶ksal, MSc. student at Technical University of Munich, and a Machine Learning Engineer based in MÃ¼nich. I'm passionate about working on complex problems and making them easier. I love learning about state of art research and leverage them to solve real world problems.
I have worked on different tasks of machine learning such as Unsupervised (Video) Segmentation, Self-Supervised Learning, Image Generation and Manipulation, Multi-modal learning and Named Entity Recongition.

## Skills
 
- Programming Languages: Python, C++, 
- Tools & Technologies: Pytorch, Knet, React, Node.js, MongoDB

## Projects

- [**Graph Neural Networks on Abdominal Organs**](https://github.com/caghankoksal/organ-mesh-registration-and-property-prediction) - Explored capabilities Graph Neural Networks on organ mesh data. Use GNNs to predict Age, BMI, Sex, Height and weight of the patients.
- [**Explaining Medical Image Classifiers with Visual Question Answering Models**](https://github.com/caghankoksal/vqa-med) - Research project on medical visual question answering problem. Explored capabilities of multi-modal Flamingo architecture and domain specific image and text encoders such as PubmedCLIP, PubmedBERT etc.
- [**Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Comics**](https://github.com/inzva/emotion-recognition-drawings) Worked on Emotion Recognition task on the Golden Age comics. Both text and image modalities are leveraged and fused to classify the emotion of the character.
- [**Face Generation In Golden Age Comics:**](https://github.com/barisbatuhan/SSuperGAN) Worked on Context-based Face Generation in Golden Age Comics (US Comics between the 1930s-1950s). The model predicts the masked face by giving consecutive comic book panels to the model with a randomly selected face masked at the last frame.
